## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I learned about the following:

- How to make use of the BEM notation.
- How to make use of font files.
- How to use the `clamp()` css function to create responsive texts.

### Useful resources

- [BEM in 6 minutes - CSS Methodology 2024](https://youtu.be/xaXmoVZ3koo?si=MqZK9nB8NWEZs2QK) - This helped me learn about the BEM notaion really easily. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
